This project is a sample app for a rails engine that relies on rspec, factory\_girl,
and capybara-webkit. It is setup from the rails guide for engines. It is a mythical
news site that contains articles.

It can run both Test::Unit tests and Rspec tests. The reason to include the Test::Unit
tests is because that is how it is setup in the guide.
